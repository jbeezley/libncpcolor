The next 7 palettes are from the Yorick scientific visalisation package,
an evolution of the GIST package, both by David H. Munro.
They are released under a BSD-like license (see LICENSE.YORICK).

Most palette functions have been reduced to simple function descriptions
by Reinier Heeres, since the rgb components were mostly straight lines.
gist_earth_data and gist_ncar_data were simplified by a script and some
manual effort.
