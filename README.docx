\brief A library for creating pseudo-color images from netCDF files.
\author Jonathan Beezley
\version 0.0.0
\section classes Classes
The user of this library interacts with the following classes:

* * NcSliceFile
* * \link ::Variable Variable<double> \endlink
* * SliceType
* * LinearNorm
* * LookupTable

The standard usage involves the following steps:
* -# opening a netCDF file with NcSliceFile
* -# retrieving a pointer to a ::Variable object with NcSliceFile::getVariable
* -# instantiating a SliceType object
* -# reading data from the variable with Variable::readSlice
* -# normalizing the variable's data to a \p uint8_t array using a LinearNorm object
* -# loading a predefined LookupTable with LookupTable::getLUT
* -# generating a raster image by calling LookupTable::makePColor
* -# calling \ref write_png to write the image to a png file

See \ref basic.cpp for an example of this procedure.
